The proliferation of smart devices for mobile networks is a major traffic generator nowadays. These devices provide the ability to receive media content in nearly every situation. Despite that video streaming in high quality is getting more and more popular in mobile scenarios, the performance and bottlenecks of mobile applications over wireless networks, especially, during the transmission of media streams, are poorly understood yet. In order to tackle this new challenge, we present an Android based framework to capture the relevant wireless network behavior, geo-coordinates and packet traces for popular streaming applications on Android certified devices. A dataset has been obtained by measurement trials, which have been performed in a 3G network for both HTTP and peer-to-peer video streaming applications. The trials comprise also an additional WiFi measurement for comparison purposes. The presented dataset enables future research to determine the quality of service and network characteristics of different streaming methodologies, which are affected by the typical conditions encountered in wireless networks, like hand-over effects, signal fading, connection losses etc. The presented dataset and the framework, may prove to be useful for the traffic measurement and the multimedia research communities.
