EPFL-PoliMI video quality assessment database contains 156 video streams encoded with H.264/AVC and corrupted by simulating the packet loss due to transmission errors over the network. The material includes one set of 78 video sequences at CIF spatial resolution and another set of 78 sequences at 4CIF spatial resolution. We also include the results of the subjective tests carried out at the premises of 2 academic institutions, Politecnico di Milano - Italy and Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne - Switzerland. Fourty naive subjects took part in the subjective tests.
