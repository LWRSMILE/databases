The new LIVE Mobile Video Quality Assessment (VQA) database consists of 200 distorted videos created from 10 RAW HD reference videos obtained using a RED ONE digital cinematographic camera. While the LIVE Mobile VQA database includes distortions that have been previously studied such as compression and wireless packet-loss, it also incorporates dynamically varying distortions that change as a function of time, such as frame-freezes and temporally varying compression rates. LIVE Mobile VQA database includes the subjective study, the human behavioral analysis, and the evaluation of current objective image and video quality assessment (IQA/VQA) algorithm with regards to their efficacy in predicting visual quality. LIVE has developed a Mobile VQA database that will supplement the LIVE Image/Video Quality Database, to provide researchers with a much-needed tool to advance the state-of-the-art in objective video quality assessment.
