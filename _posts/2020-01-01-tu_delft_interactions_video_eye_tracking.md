The interactions database was designed to invesigate on the deviations of quality scoring saliency from free looking saliency. In particular, the effect of two factor is of interest: the quality level of the images evaluated, and the distortion affecting them. Eye movements were recorded by means of a SensoMotoric Instruments GmbH Eye Tracker while 14 subjects were scoring the quality of 54 distorted stimuli with the Single Stimulus method with continuous numerical scaling. The stimuli used in the experiment consisted of several distorted versions of 6 original images selected from the LIVE database. These were selected such that we had a fair representation of different content, including images with and without a clear region of interest, images with and without humans in the picture, and images with various amounts of textured components. To evaluate the effect of distortion type and quality level, various distorted version of these original images were chosen from the LIVE database. Three kinds of distortions were considered, namely JPEG compression, White noise and Gaussian Blur. For each original image and distortion type, three different quality levels were selected: a highly distorted one, one with a medium distortion level, and one for which the applied distortion just slightly compromised the quality. The interaction database includes, together with the original stimuli, the corresponding fixation and saliency maps and the MOS obtained from the scoring task. The experimental procedure is described in more detail in the paper "Interactions of visual attention and quality perception".
