8 original color images were used, 200 distorted images were generated from 5 different encryption techniques with 5 parameters. Subjective evaluations were made at viewing distance of 6 times the screen height using a "Pair Comparison" protocol method with 5 categories and 21 observers. Distortions for each processing and each image have been optimised in order to uniformly cover the subjective scale. The source code for running the subjective experiment can be found here: http://www.irccyn.ec-nantes.fr/~autrusse/jnd/SDLPairComp.zip.
