title: Biomedical databases for 3D image quality assessment
total: ''
---

Two databases to foster the collaboration with other EU projects are presented. The first one corresponds to 3D Electron Microscopy volumes. Two distinct data sets are provided: one noiseless and another one with noise. Inside each dataset there are several volumes with and without digital filtering. This dataset is related with the INSTRUCT project (Integrated Structural Biology Infraestructure (FP7‐211252)). The second database is related with a recently approved COST project on bimodal PET‐MRI molecular imaging (TD1007). The data set consists of different reconstruction algorithms with a without noise.
