All video sequences are in the uncompressed YUV4MPEG format used by the mjpegtools project unless otherwise indicated. This is the format accepted by the Theora encoder tools. Some encoding parameters such as framerate that were missing from the raw data have been guessed or inferred, and may be incorrect. All sequences listed here were available at one time on publicly accessible servers or were given to us explicitly to host here, and are believed to be freely redistributable. When available, the appropriate copyright information is included. Some may impose additional restrictions or limitations. See the appropriate copyright file for details. The list contains about 50 sequences with SD content and below, and about 30 sequences with HD content and above.
