Subjective tests have been conducted, involving 25 stereo image pairs and 20 subjects, to compare the overall performance of 4 anaglyph generation methods. 5 images are selected in another experiment to evaluate the image quality regarding specific distortions, e.g., chrominance accuracy, retinal rivalry, and ghosting effect.
