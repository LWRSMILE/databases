This database contains 168 videos sequences, the subjective results and auxiliary data such as the transmitted video files. 9 different video source contents were used. For each content, the reference (without degradation) and 15 different degradations called Hypothetical Reference Circuits (HRCs) were subjectively evaluated. The HRCs are based on H.264 and MPEG2 coding with and without transmission errors. We provide a spreadsheet with the individual scores and the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for each of the 168 Processed Video Sequences (PVS).
