The IRCCyN IVC DIBR Videos quality database contains 102 video sequences of 6 seconds in 1024x768 resolution with between 15 and 30 frames per second. Individual votes and MOS scores obtained by an ACR-HR experiment are provided. Three different multiview plus depth (MVD) sequences are considered in this database. The sequences are Book Arrival (1024x768, 16 cameras with 6.5cm spacing), Lovebird1 (1024x768, 12 cameras with 3.5 cm spacing) and Newspaper (1024x768, 9 cameras with 5 cm spacing). Seven DIBR algorithms processed the three sequences to generate, for each sequence, four new viewpoints.
