The NUSEF (NUS Eye Fixation) database was acquired from undergraduate and graduate volunteers aged 18-35 years (μ=24.9, σ=3.4). The ASLT M eye-tracker was used to non-invasively record eye fixations, as subjects free-viewed image stimuli. We chose a diverse set of 1024 × 728 resolution images, representative of various semantic concepts and capturing objects at varying scale, illumination and orientation, based on quality and aspect ratio constraints. Images comprised everyday scenes from Flickr, aesthetic content from Photo.net, Google images and emotion-evoking IAPS pictures.
