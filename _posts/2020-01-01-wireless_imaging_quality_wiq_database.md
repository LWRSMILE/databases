The Wireless Imaging Quality (WIQ) Database  is available from the Radio Communication Group at the Blekinge Institute of Technology. In this case 40 images were evaluated by 30 non-expert viewers. The database focuses on gray-scale JPEG compressed images and distortions caused by a simulated wireless channel. Seven reference images were used in the subjective experiments, 80 distorted (test) images were used in the subjective experiments, subjective scores for all 80 images are obtained from the two subjective experiments.
