This database contains eyetracker data and the associated videos. The videos are with various content, the reference (without processing or degradation) and four error transmission simulations. The H.264 distorted videos are also provided. There is one spreadsheet with the individual score and the MOS for each video. A text file presents the general conditions of this test. It is a quality task experiment. The bit-rates are selected to have a good quality if we not aware on the transmission errors. The dataset contains subjective ratings as well as eyetracking data from 30 observers for 100 SD videos.
