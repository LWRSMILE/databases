Bandwidth fluctuation in mobile networks severely effects the quality of service (QoS) of bandwidth-sensitive applications such as video streaming. Using bandwidth statistics it is possible to predict the network behaviour and take proactive actions to counter network fluctuations, which in turn can improve the QoS. In this paper, we present comprehensive bandwidth datasets from extensive measurement campaigns conducted in Sydney on both 3G and 4G networks under vehicular driving conditions. A particularly distinguishing feature of our dataset is that we have collected data from repeated trips along a few routes. Thus our data can be useful to obtain statistically significant results on network performance in an urban setting. We outline the measurement methodology and present key insights obtained from the collected traces. We have made our dataset available to the wider research community.
