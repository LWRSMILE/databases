Eye-tracking data were collected in order to better understand how people watch videos when assessing their quality level. In the experiment, two groups of viewers were shown video segments and were given two different tasks. One was to simply look at the video as if they were watching TV or an internet downloaded video. The other was to assess the quality level of the videos. With the eye tracker, it was possible to track the eye movement of the viewers and map the salient regions for images given the different tasks and with different levels of video quality.
