title: World-Wide Scale Geotagged Image Dataset for Automatic Image Annotation and
  Reverse Geotagging
total: 14000000
---

A dataset of geotagged photos on a world-wide scale is presented. The dataset contains a sample of more than 14 million geotagged photos crawled from Flickr with the corresponding metadata. To guarantee the spatial representativeness of the dataset, a crawling approach based on the small-world phenomena and the Flickr friendship's graph is applied. Furthermore, the noisiness of user-provided tags is reduced through an automatic tag cleaning approach. To enable efficient retrieval, photos in the dataset are indexed based on their location information using quad-tree data structure. The dataset can assists different applications, especially, search-based automatic image annotation and reverse geotagging.
