The CID2013 Camera Image Database consists of real images taken by consumer cameras and mobile phones. It is developed to provide useful tool to allow researchers target more commercially relevant distortions when developing processes of objective image quality assessment algorithms. The CID2013 database consists of 480 images captured by 79 imaging devices (mobile phones, DSC, DSLR) in six Image Sets. The images are evaluated by 188 observers using Dynamic Reference (DR-ACR) method (explained below). A separate scale realignment ACR data consisting evaluations from 34 observers is also included that allows to combine the data from the six image sets.
