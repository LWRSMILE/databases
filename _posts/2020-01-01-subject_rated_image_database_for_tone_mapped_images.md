title: Subject-rated image database for tone-mapped images
---

Tone mapping operators (TMOs) that convert high dynamic range (HDR) to low dynamic range (LDR) images provide practically useful tools for the visualization of HDR images on standard LDR displays. Different TMOs create different tone mapped images, and a natural question is which one has the best quality. A straight-forward approach is to invite human subjects to rate or rank the quality of tone-mapped images. This database provides 15 image sets, each of which contains an HDR image along with 8 tone-mapped images created by different TMOs.
