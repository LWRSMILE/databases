The gallery includes eight HDR images under a liberal Creative Commons license, which can be downloaded to start experimenting with HDR. Although there are thousands of tone-mapped "HDR" images on Flickr, the original HDR images are usually not available. The images in this gallery do not have much artistic value but should be good enough to try different algorithms.
