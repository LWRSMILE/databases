title: 'LaRED: A Large RGB-D Extensible Hand Gesture Dataset'
total: 243000
---

The LaRED is recorded with the Intel's short range depth camera (the model number: VF0780-SDK-CE). In particular, the LaRED dataset contains 27 gestures in 3 different orientations, which makes a total of 81 classes. We have 10 subjects performing the corresponding hand gesture and 300 images are collected from each subject with the Intel camera providing a pair of synchornized color and depth images. Meanwhile, a mask image is given to localize the boundary of the gesture-performing hand.
