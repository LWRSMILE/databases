The PairComp TMO images database contains 100 images in FullHD (1920x1080 pixels) resolution. The results of the Pair Comparison are provided with the images. 10 High Dynamic Range (HDR) images were processed with 9 sets of parameter of Tone Mapper Operators to produce 90 LDR images. The HDR contents were displayed like a reference for the half of participants. We used Pair Comparison with reduced matrix (not full matrix) as test methodology. This database was created to compare different TMOs and sets of parameters. The goal is to know which one are the preferred one knowing or not the HDR reference.
