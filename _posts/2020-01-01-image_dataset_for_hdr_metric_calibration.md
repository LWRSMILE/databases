HDR-VDP is a visual metric that compares a pair of images (a reference and a test image) and predicts. The metric can be used for testing fidelity (e.g. how distracting are image compression distortions), or visibility (is the information sufficiently visible). The great care was taken to calibrate the HDR-VDP-2 with the experimental data. The selected data sets are planned to be released so that others can benchmark their metrics against HDR-VDP-2.
