Video databases often focus on a particular use case with a limited set of sequences. In this paper, a different type of database creation is proposed: an exhaustive number of test conditions will be continuously created and made freely available for objective and subjective evaluation. At the moment, the database comprises more than ten thousand JM/x264-encoded video sequences. An extensive study of the possible encoding parameter space led to a first subset selection of 1296 configurations. At the moment, only ten source sequences have been used, but extension to more than one hundred sequences is planned. Some Full-Reference (FR) and No-Reference (NR) metrics were selected and calculated. The resulting data will be freely available to the research community and possible exploitation areas are suggested.
