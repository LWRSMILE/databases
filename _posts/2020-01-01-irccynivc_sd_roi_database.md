This database contains the videos and associated subjective scores. The videos are provided with various content and  H.264 coding with or without error transmission simulations. The H.264 distorted videos are also provided. There is one spreadsheet with the individual score and the MOS for each video. The bit-rates are selected to have a good quality if we are not aware of the transmission errors.
