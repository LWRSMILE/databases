Little performance data currently exists for streaming high-quality Internet video to residential users. Data on streaming performance provides valuable input to the design of new protocols and applications, for example when evaluating congestion control and error-correction schemes, and for sizing playout buffers in video receivers. This paper presents measurements of streaming real-time UDP traffic to a number of residential users, and discusses the basic characteristics of the data. The following datasets are referenced from the paper. They contain measurements of CBR RTP traffic, sent from a campus machine to receivers connected to the Internet via ADSL and Cable links. Dataset-A contains only end-to-end measurements, while Dataset-B also includes some end-to-middle measurements obtained using TTL-limited probes, and packet-pair measurements from which the path capacities can be estimated. Dataset-A was collected between June and October 2009, while Dataset-B was collected between April and September 2010.
