The Bi-Plane data set was acquried by ScanLAB Projects ( Unit 7, 5 Durham Yard / London E2 6QF / Great Britain). It consists of the scan of a Handley Page Gugnunc - G-AACN - which is currently exhibited at the Science Museum, Wroughton. The Handley Page H.P.39 was a wooden biplane from the 1920s. The aircraft was intended to compete in a competition proposed by the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics - the Guggenheim Safe aircraft Competition.
