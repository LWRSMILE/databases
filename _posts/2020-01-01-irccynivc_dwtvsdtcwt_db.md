12 original grayscale images were used (from the BOWS-2 contest), 120 distorted images were generated from 5 embedding strengths either in the wavelet domain (DWT) or using the Dual Tree Complex Wavelet transform (DT-CWT). Subjective evaluations were made at viewing distance of 6 times the screen height using a DSIS (Double Stimulus Impairment Scale) method with 5 categories and 14 observers. Distortions for each processing and each image have been optimised in order to uniformly cover the subjective scale.
