The CVD video database is developed to provide an useful tool for researchers in the validation and developing processes of no-reference (NR) objective video quality assessment (VQA) algorithms. It consists of 234 videos from five different scenes captured by 78 different cameras (mobile phones, compact camera, video camera, SLR). The subjective experiments are conducted following the Single-Stimulus (SS) procedure to collect ratings of video quality. Moreover, objective test chart data are measured and can be used to analyze performance of capturing devices.
