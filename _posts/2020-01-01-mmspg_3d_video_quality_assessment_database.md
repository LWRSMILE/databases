The EPFL database (MMSPG 3D) contains 3D video quality test material (1920x1080) where the test conditions represent different camera distances [GDE10]. There were 20 subjects participants in the test and the camera distances were set to 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 cm. The subjective test campaign was conducted using 46'' polarized stereoscopic display with a native resolution of 1920x1080 pixels which is used to display the test stimuli.
