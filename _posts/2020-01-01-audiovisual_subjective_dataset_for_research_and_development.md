In 2011, the Video Quality Experts Group (VQEG) ran subjects through the same audiovisual subjective test at six different international laboratories. That small dataset is now publically available for research and development purposes. Ten sets of audiovisual MOS values are available for vqegMM2. Six laboratories conducted the experiment in a controlled environment. Four labs repeated the experiment in a public environment. These opinion scores are available on CDVL (www.cdvl.org).
