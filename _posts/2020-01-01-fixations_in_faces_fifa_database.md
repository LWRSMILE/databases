title: Fixations In Faces (FiFa) DataBase
total: 313
---

This FiFa database is dedicated to sharing data pertaining to observers viewing of faces in natural scenes. The data provided includes subjects' viewing of images containing faces, showing that faces are attracting the attention. Fixations are provided in Matlab format.
Additionally, a Matlab code used for determining the saliency of locations in given images is provided. This code is used to predict the locations of subjects fixations in images.
