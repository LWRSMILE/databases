The data is based on a subjective lab experiment in which participants (N=32) had to browse four different websites at different network speeds resulting in different levels of experienced responsiveness. The websites were different in terms of technical complexity (number of objects, etc.) and genre (encyclopedia, cooking community, news portal, travel portal). For the web browsing test conditions, test subjects experienced different maximum network downlink bandwidth settings (32-1024 kbit/s). In each condition, a browser session with the corresponding website was initiated and users asked to perform a certain browsing scenario on a Windows notebook. After each condition, subjects were asked to rate their overall quality experience (on a 9-point ACR scale) as well as other aspects like overall acceptability. This test methodology conforms with ITU-T Rec. P.1501.
