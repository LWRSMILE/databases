RMIT3DV is a library of uncompressed stereoscopic 3D HD video, designed to represent a diverse range of content and visual conditions to enable its use in a variety of (research) applications. Currently composed of 31 sequences, shots were designed taking into consideration: level of 3D effect, aesthetic composition, variations in colour, environment (e.g., natural/urban), motion (e.g., traffic/pedestrian/natural), texture (e.g., water, natural greenery, buildings, people, transport), and light (e.g., day/night, natural/artificial, light reflections/shadows). The sequences were all filmed at various indoor and outdoor locations around RMIT University (City Campus) and the Melbourne CBD region. The database was natively filmed on a Panasonic AG-3DA1 HD 3D camera using Blackmagic Hyperdeck Shuttles and Intel SATA3 SSDs (formatted as HFS+) to record the uncompressed video content. Sequences are 1920 x 1080 HD resolution, 10-bit 4:2:2 YUV at 25 fps (no audio content - yet!) More technical details about the camera rigging, pre-production, stereography, filming and post-production processes and workflows are available here. Funded by the Smart Services CRC, RMIT3DV is part of a research collaboration between a team of researchers led by Prof. Ian Burnett (School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, RMIT University) and Alex Joseski and Jonathan Burton (Alex and Jono Films) in Melbourne, Australia. For optimal 3D viewing results, it is recommended that the content be viewed on a 25.5 inch (or 65cm) 3D-capable monitor, where the ideal position of the viewer's eye-level is in line with the vertical and horizontal centre of the screen.
