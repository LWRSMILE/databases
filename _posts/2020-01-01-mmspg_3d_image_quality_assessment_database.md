The database contains stereoscopic images with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels. Various indoor and outdoor scenes with a large variety of colors, textures, and depth structures have been captured. Each of the scenes has been captured with different camera distances in the range 10-50 cm. Since the acquisition was done in a sequential way the content of a single scene may vary slightly across the different camera distance. However, the general 2D (color, texture, motion) and 3D (depth) characteristics are preserved. The database contains 10 scenes, shown in the figure below, with difference characteristics.
