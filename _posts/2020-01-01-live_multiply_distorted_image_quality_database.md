A subjective study was conducted in two parts to obtain human judgments on images corrupted under two multiple distortion scenarios: 1) image storage where images are first blurred and then compressed by a JPEG encoder. 2) camera image acquisition process where images are first blurred due to narrow depth of field or other defocus and then corrupted by white Gaussian noise to simulate sensor noise.
