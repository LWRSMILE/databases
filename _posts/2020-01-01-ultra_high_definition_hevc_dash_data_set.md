The sequences provided in this dataset are a professional edit of several sequences shot during the 4Ever project (http://www.4ever-project.com/). The sequences have been captured using a Sony F65 in raw mode, processed in BT.709 Gamut. The edited sequence is an UHDTV 3840x2160 progressive video at 60 Hz, and lasts 8536 frames, which corresponds to 2 minutes, 22 seconds and 226 milliseconds (16 frames). The sequence has been spatially down-sampled to generate HD (1280x720p60) and Full HD (1920x1080p60) sequences, which in turn have been temporally down-sampled at 30 Hz. The UHDTV sequence has not been temporally down-sampled, as most subjective viewing tests conducted by the 4Ever project on 4K materials at 30 Hz were not advocating for this. The provided DASH sequences provide HEVC encoding ranging from 720p30 @ 2Mbps up to 2160p60 @ 20 Mbps, with one 1080p60 and one 2160p60 in 10 bits .
