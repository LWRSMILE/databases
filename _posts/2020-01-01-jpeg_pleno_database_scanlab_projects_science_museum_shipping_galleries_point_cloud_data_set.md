The Shipping Galleries at the Science Museum were 3D scanned before their decommissioning in 2012 by William Trossell and Matthew Shaw of ScanLAB Projects. A total of 256 scans were taken of the space and its exhibits to create a digital model of over 2 billion precisely measured points. This digital replica has been used to create a virtual flythrough of the gallery spaces with curator David Rooney providing detailed narration about the key exhibits and artefacts.
