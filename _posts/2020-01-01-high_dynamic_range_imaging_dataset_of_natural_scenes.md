This dataset contains the HDR data (including illuminant) of 88 images, Matlab files that read the HDR data and produce the summary images, the sensor spectral QE, example script  for reading and analyzing the data. For each HDR image, it is provided: Luminance histogram (PDF), Illuminant spectral power distribution (PDF), Highly compressed and sub-sampled rgb image, Pseudo-color image showing (50 x log luminance) (cd/m^2).
