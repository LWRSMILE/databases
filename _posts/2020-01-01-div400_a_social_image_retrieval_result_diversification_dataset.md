New dataset, Div400, was designed to support shared evaluation in different areas of social media photo retrieval, e.g., machine analysis (re-ranking, machine learning), human-based computation (crowdsourcing) or hybrid approaches (relevance feedback, machine-crowd integration). Div400 comes with associated relevance and diversity assessments performed by human annotators. 396 landmark locations are represented via 43,418 Flickr photos and metadata, Wikipedia pages and content descriptors for text and visual modalities. To facilitate distribution, only Creative Commons content was included in the dataset. The proposed dataset was validated during the 2013 Retrieving Diverse Social Images Task at the MediaEval Benchmarking Initiative for Multimedia Evaluation.
