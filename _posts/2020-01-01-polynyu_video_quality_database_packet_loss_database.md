Smaller dataset investigates the impact of packet loss in H.264 videos (PolyNYU PL). This subjective data consist of two parts: one is for quality evaluation of individual loss-impaired frames, and the other is for quality evaluation of entire loss-impaired segments (due to error propagation). A total of 17 videos are selected from wide variety of standard test sequences, and rated by 32 viewers. The subjective test is performed adopting the ACR-HR 5 scale standard. These subjective tests mainly target the low bitrate video application. The test videos are encoded/decoded adopting  H.264 standard. During each loss event, one entire frame is lost, and frame-copy error concealment is utilized.
