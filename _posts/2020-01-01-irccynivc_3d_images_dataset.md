This database contains 96 stereoscopic images and their associated subjective scores.
Six different stereoscopic images are considered in this database which is composed of the six reference images (undistorted) and fifteen distorted version of each sources generated from three different processings (JPEG, JPEG2000, blurring) symmetrically to the stereopair images. A spreedshit "Details_images_with_DMOS" gives the distortion applicated, the degradation level and the Difference Mean Opinion Score (DMOS) associated for each stereoscopic paires. For more precise explanation on the degradation applied, please read the degradation section The result of this database could be used to design new metrics for 3D quality assessment.
