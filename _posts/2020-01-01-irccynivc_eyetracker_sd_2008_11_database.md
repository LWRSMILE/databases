This database contains eyetracker data and the associated videos. The videos are several contents coded in H.264. The bit-rates are selected to have a good quality. A text file presents the general conditions of this test. It is a free task experiment. The bit-rates are selected to have a good quality. The goal is to collect saliency maps to test an area of interest protection software on these videos. Dataset contains eyetracking data from 37 observers for 51 H.264-compressed SD videos.
