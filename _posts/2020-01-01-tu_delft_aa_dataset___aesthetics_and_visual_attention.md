Predicting the aesthetic appeal of (consumer) images is of great interest for a number of applications, from image retrieval to visual quality optimization. A key element in determining the beauty of an image is the ability of the photographer to guide the attention of the viewer to the subject of interest. To this purpose, both image simplicity (i.e., clarity of the subject ) and compositional rules (e.g., the well-known rule of thirds), are used to drive the observerâ€™s visual focus and ease perceptual fluency. Quite interestingly, although these are well-accepted rules-of-thumb for good photography, there has been very little effort in validating them in a scientific way, especially towards investigating the interactions between image aesthetic appeal appreciation and visual attention deployment. The A&A dataset aims at providing a basis for performing such more rigorous validation.  The dataset consists of 200 images, their subjective ratings on Aesthetic Appeal, Color likeability, Recognizability and Familiarity, and their respective fixation and saliency maps.
