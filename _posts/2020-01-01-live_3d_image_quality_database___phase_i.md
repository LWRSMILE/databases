The 3D IQA database consists of 20 reference images and 365 distorted images (80 each for JP2K, JPEG, WN and FF; 45 for Blur) with co-registered human scores in the form of DMOS. All distortions are symmetric in nature. Apart from human opinion scores for every distorted image, the database also provides researchers access with `true' depth and disparity information of every reference image obtained from a range scanner, which all of the above databases lack. The image and range data used in this study were collected using an advanced terrestrial range scanner, the RIEGL VZ-400, with a co-registered 12.1 megapixel Nikon D700 digital camera mounted on top of it.
