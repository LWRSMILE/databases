## How do I add a database?

If you want to add a database, you have multiple options:

1. [Fill out the Google Form](https://forms.gle/efq21aVdtjDPbRrRA) and we will take care of it.
1. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/QUALINET/databases/issues/new) on GitHub and fill out the required information
1. If you have experience with GitHub, [fork this repository](https://github.com/qualinet/databases/fork) and add your own database in the `_posts` folder. Look at the other databases to see how the syntax works. After committing to your fork, create a *Pull Request*.
