The EEG datasets (in MATLAB format) that were used to produce the results in the paper EEG Correlates of Pleasant and Unpleasant Odor Perception. The dataset consists of 5 subjects. The necessary explanatory files are included in the folder. The files published here allow to reproduce the results in the aforementioned paper, but can also be used as a basis for your own research on odor pleasantness perception from EEG signals. Should you use the datasets for your own publications please do not forget to cite our paper.
