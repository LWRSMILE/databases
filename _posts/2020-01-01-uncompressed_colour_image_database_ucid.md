title: Uncompressed Colour Image Database (UCID)
total: 1300
---

The aim of the UCID is to provide a benchmark dataset for image retrieval. The database has over 1300 images together with a ground truth (predefined query images with corresponding model images that should be retrieved). It is envisaged that the dataset is used for the evaluation of image retrieval techniques.
