The LIVE Video Quality Database (LIVE VQD) includes MPEG-2 and H.264 compression and simulated transmission of H.264 compressed bitstreams through IP wired and wireless networks with errors. A set of 150 distorted videos were created from ten reference videos (15 distorted videos per reference) using four different distortion types and the database was assessed by 38 human subjects. Each video in the LIVE Video Quality Database was assessed by 38 human subjects in a single stimulus study with hidden reference removal, where the subjects scored the video quality on a continuous quality scale.
