This database contains 150 images, the subjective results including votes and Mean Opinion Scores. 10 different still image contents were used. For each content, the reference (without degradation) and 14 different degradations called Hypothetical Reference Circuits (HRCs) were subjectively evaluated.

The HRCs are based on JPEG coding and are completely presented in the paper [NPL13]. This JPEG coding is apply on the original images with 7 different bitrates. Two objective optimization criteria are used. A description of the SRC and the HRC is provided in the description file including the description of the viewing environment in which the image quality was evaluated.
