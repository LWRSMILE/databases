The dataset constitutes a challenging benchmark for methods that detect social events in large collections of multimedia items. More specifically, the dataset comprises more than 160 thousands of Flickr photos and their accompanying metadata, as well as a list of 149 manually selected and annotated target events, each of which is defined as a set of relevant photos. The paper also discusses the challenges defined as part of SED 2012, the data collection process, the dataset and its basic statistics, the ground truth creation and the suggested evaluation methodology.
