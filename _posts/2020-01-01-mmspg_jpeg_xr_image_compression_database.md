The new JPEG XR technology has been compared to existing JPEG and JPEG 2000 algorithms, considering compression of high resolution 24 bpp pictures, by mean of a campaign of subjective quality assessment tests which followed the general guidelines provided in the core experiment plan described in the document WG1N5001 by the AIC JPEG XR ad-hoc group. Sixteen naive subjects took part in experiments at EPFL and each subject participated in four test sessions, scoring a total of 186 test stimuli. A detailed procedure for the statistical analysis of subjective data is also proposed, which allows an accurate comparison of codec performance.
