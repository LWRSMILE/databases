This dataset contains a directory structure consisting of several 3-D models (both point clouds and naked/textured meshes) reconstructed from 2-D pictures by GTI-UPM within the activities of the EU-funded research project FP7-ICT-610691, BRIDGET (BRIDging the Gap for Enhanced broadcasT). GTI-UPM donates these models for usage in scientific experiments, provided that an acknowledgment be explicitly made in any publication derived from its use. Such an acknowledgement should contain the following information: "Some 3D models/point clouds/meshes used in this work were kindly provided by GTI-UPM, which was funded by the European Commission within project BRIDGET (grant FP7-ICT-610691)".
