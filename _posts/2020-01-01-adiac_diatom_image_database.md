title: ADIAC Diatom Image Database
---

This database contains images acquired as part of the ADIAC project (= Automatic Diatom Identification and Classification), which aims at developing a fully automated, unsupervised system for the identification of diatoms. As part of this, a large reference database is required which contains "standards" that each input specimen has to be compared against. Here, we are making these images available for public use, as they are obviously also useful as a supplementary identification aid. All images are acquired as 8-bit greyscales using brightfield light microscopy and a 1018x1008 pixel CCD camera.
