The Visual Attention for Image Quality Database (VAIQ) is available from the Radio Communication Group at the Blekinge Institute of Technology. The database contains gaze patterns of 15 observers and saliency maps for 42 reference images from the IRCCyN/IVC, MICT, and LIVE databases as mentioned above.
