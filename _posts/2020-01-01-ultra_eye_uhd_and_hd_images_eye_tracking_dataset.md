Understanding human attention patterns and viewing strategies for UHD content is important for developing efficient data compression algorithms and accurate objective quality metrics. To help studying these properties and their dynamics when HD content is replaced with UHD content, we provide a publicly accessible dataset, called Ultra-Eye, which is composed of 41 4K UHD and HD images in TIFF format with corresponding eye tracking information. The eye tracking information includes the fixation points and fixation density maps measured during extensive subjective experiments. The dataset can be used for research purposes.
