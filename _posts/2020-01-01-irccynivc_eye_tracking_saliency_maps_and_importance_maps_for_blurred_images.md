This image database contains 72 images. There are 6 versions of each still image content. The original added to 5 power of blur. The 12 original images come from the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset as specified in our paper. The database was created to evaluate a no-reference metric that quantifies perceived image quality induced by blur.
