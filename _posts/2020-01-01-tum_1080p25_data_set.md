The TUM 1080p25 Data Set consists of the subjective test results and bitstreams of four different HDTV 1080p25 video sequences of the SVT test set (CrowdRun, InToTree, OldTownCross and ParkJoy), encoded with two H.264/AVC encoder settings and Dirac at four different rate points between 5-30 MBit/s, resulting in 48 different data points. For H.264/AVC, two different encoder settings were chosen, one low-complexity main profile (LC) and one high-complextiy high profile (HC). The bitstreams can be found in the corresponding sub directories and the subjective test results in the Excel sheet. The references from the SVT test set used to create the data set can be downloaded in YUV 4:2:0 8 Bit format from the folder References.
