This database consists of 456 Full HD H.264/AVC encoded and impaired video sequences. Each sequence has a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, a frame rate of 25 fps and a duration of exactly 10 seconds. All sequences are progressive. Nine different encoder configurations were used and network impairments were injected by dropping single and multiple slices in the encoded video files. This database includes the encoded and impaired bitstreams and the corresponding decoded videos. Each video sequence has been subjectively evaluated by 24 subjects. Post-experiment screening of the test subjects, as detailed in Annex V of the VQEG HDTV report, was used to eliminate outliers from the response data. Different trace files are also included in this subjective video database which provide detailed information on the video content and location of the loss. These trace files can be used to locate the position of the loss in terms of missing pictures, slices, NAL units, and RTP packets.
