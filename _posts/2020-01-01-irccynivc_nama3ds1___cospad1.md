This 3D video quality database contains 110 3D stereoscopic videos sequences and the associated subjective results. 10 different video source contents were used that originate from the NAMA3DS1 database. For each content, the reference (without degradation) and 10 different degradations called Hypothetical Reference Circuits (HRCs) were subjectively evaluated in an ITU conforming environment. The HRCs are based on H.264 and JPEG2000 coding and typical image proccessing steps like downsampling and image sharpening. A description of the SRC and the HRC is provided in the description file added to the description of the viewing and environmental condition in which the videos were evaluated. Absolute Category Rating - Hidden Reference (ACR-HR) was used as test methodology. Please note that the type of degradations added to the sequences are mainly impacting on the image (video) quality scale and therefore this experiment should not be used to evaluate 3D subjective scales such as visual comfort, depth quality or immersion as the degradations have not been introduced particularly for these scales and the results would be strongly biased.
