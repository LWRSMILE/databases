The increasing amount of digital multimedia content available is inspiring potential new types of user interaction with video data. Users want to easily find the content by searching and browsing. For this reason, techniques are needed that allow automatic categorisation, searching the content and linking to related information. The presented dataset contains comprehensive semi-professional user-generated (SPUG) content, including audiovisual content, user-contributed metadata, automatic speech recognition transcripts, automatic shot boundary files, and social information for multiple 'social levels'. The principal characteristics of this dataset are described and results are presented that have been achieved on different tasks.
