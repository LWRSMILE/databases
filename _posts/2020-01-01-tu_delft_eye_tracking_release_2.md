Eye-tracking data were collected in order to better understand how people look to images when assessing image quality. In the experiment, people were showed images and were given two different tasks. One was to simply look at the images as if they were looking at a photo album. The other was to assess the quality level of the images. With the eye tracker it was possible to track the eye movement of the viewers and map the salient regions for images given different tasks and with different levels of image quality. Dataset contains eyetracking data from 75 observers for 160 JPEG-compressed images.
