This database contains 96 still images and their associated subjective scores. Three different multiview plus depth (MVD) sequences are considered in this database. The sequences are Book Arrival (1024x768, 16 cameras with 6.5cm spac-ing), Lovebird1 (1024x768, 12 cameras with 3.5 cm spacing) and Newspaper (1024x768, 9 cameras with 5 cm spacing). Seven DIBR algorithms processed the three sequences to generate, for each sequence, four new viewpoints. These seven DIBR algorithms are labeled from A1 to A7. The test was conducted in an ITU conforming test environment. For the subjective assessments, the stimuli were displayed on a TVLogic LVM401W, and according to ITU-T BT.500. See the paper for more details.
