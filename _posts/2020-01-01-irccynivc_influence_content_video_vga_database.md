This database contains 300 videos sequences and the associated subjective results. 60 different video source contents were used. For each content, the reference (without degradation) and 4 take randomly in 20 different degradations called Hypothetical Reference Circuits (HRCs) were subjectively evaluated. The HRCs are based on H.264/SVC coding without transmission errors. Several QP repartition are tested between the base layer of the SVC stream and the enhancement layer. The videos of the database are always the enhancement layer for 16 HRC. The four other HRCs are the base layer upscaled, with different QP parameters. A spreadsheet with the individual scores and the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) is provided for each of the 300 PVS. Absolute Category Rating (ACR) was used as test methodology. The H.264/SVC HRC are coded with the JSVM coder version 9.18. The SVC layers are coded at different QP values at 30Hz. Some videos have other degradations come from common set with other available tests.
