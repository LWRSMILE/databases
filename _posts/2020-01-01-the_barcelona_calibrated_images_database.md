The database of images has been gathered using a calibrated camera and it accommodates a grey ball of known reflectance on the lower-left side of the image. Calibrating the camera aim at defining the chromatic properties of the light hitting each sensor unit (pixel) in a device-independent color space such as the CIE1931 XYZ and by adding this ball. The dataset can be used in color constancy studies or surface reflectance studies. There images of various scene types: Urban scenery, Forest & Motorways, Snow & Seaside, Natural objects 01, Natural objects 02, Natural objects 03, Natural objects 04.
