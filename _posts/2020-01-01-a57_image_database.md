title: A57 Image Database
---

It is important to note that due to the limited number of images and limited number of human subjects, the A57 database is of limited statistical reliability. It contains three reference natural images, the digital images were of size 512x512 pixels and were 8-bit grayscale with pixel values in the range 0âˆ’255. These images were distorted with six types of distortions: 1. Quantization of the LH subbands of a 5-level DWT, 2. Additive Gaussian white noise,
 3. Baseline JPEG compression of the image, 4. JPEG-2000 compression of the image, 5. JPEG-2000 compression with the Dynamic Contrast-Based Quantization (DCQ) algorithm and 6. Blurring by using a Gaussian filter.
