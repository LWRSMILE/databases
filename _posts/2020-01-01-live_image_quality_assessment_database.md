A typical example of image quality database is the one available from the Laboratory for Image & Video Engineering (LIVE) from the University of Texas at Austin, which has been used in many studies. It is popular among researchers. This LIVE Image Quality Assessment Database (LIVE IQAD) contains still images annotated with MOS ratings. The Release 2 distortions include JPEG (169 images), JPEG2000 (175 images), white noise (145 images), Gaussian blur (145 images) and JPEG2000 with bit errors in simulated Rayleigh fading channel (145 images).
