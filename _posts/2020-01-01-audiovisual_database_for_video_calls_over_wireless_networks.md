title: Audiovisual Database for Video Calls over Wireless Networks
---

The database created at the University of Plymouth is for audiovisual quality assessment which consists of 60 test conditions for video call over wireless networks. Subjective tests were performed according to ITU-T recommendations for audiovisual, video and audio, respectively. Absolute Category Rating (ACR) was used in experiments using a discrete 9-level quality scale for low-bitrate evaluations.
