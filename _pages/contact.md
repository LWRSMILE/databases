## How do I contribute?

If you want to contribute directly via GitHub, you can also:

- [Create an issue](https://github.com/qualinet/databases/issues/) and suggest a database to be added. Please fill out all the information.
- [Fork this repository](https://github.com/qualinet/databases/fork) and add your own database in the `_posts` folder. Look at the other databases to see how the syntax works. After committing to your fork, create a *Pull Request*.
