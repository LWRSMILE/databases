The dataset consists of 21 video clips (16 seconds each, full HD, 25 fps) and associated annotations in xml format of privacy-sensitive regions. Video clips show people performing various actions in indoor and outdoor environments during day and night times. The people shown in the videos are of different gender and ethnicity. Video clips are in MPEG-2 format, 16 seconds each, with a resolution of full HD resolution (1920x1080 pixels) at 25 frames per second. They were recorded using Canon HD HG21 camera and converted to MPEG-2 format with ffmpeg. There are 21 video clips in total. Several typical indoor and outdoor video surveillance scenarios were considered: simple walking (1 participant), stealing (2 participants), dropping a bag (1 participant)
fighting (2 participants). Several scenes were recorded for each scenario from two different angles by two cameras. Most of the participants in dataset recording were students from EPFL campus. Video clips show the variety of gender, race, and different personal accessories that people carry or wear.
