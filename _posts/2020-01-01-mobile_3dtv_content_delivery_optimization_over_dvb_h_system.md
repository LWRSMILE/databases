Availability of suitable test data is a crucial condition for research and development in video processing and coding. In order to lay the fundaments for further research and development in the project, a data base of stereo video was created. In total 28 stereo and multiview sequences are available to the project, which is an extremely rich data set. Half of the material is available with full copyright. The available data are listed and illustrated here. Main characteristics of the content in terms of motion, colour, texture, light, indoor/outdoor, depth, etc. are provided.
