This dataset paper describes a synthetically-generated, multi-lens stereoscopic video dataset and associated 3D models. Creating a multi-lens video stream requires that the lens be placed at a spacing less than one inch. While such cameras can be built out of off-the-shelf parts, they are not “professional” enough to allow for necessary requirements such as zoom-lens control or synchronization between cameras. Other dedicated devices exist but do not have sufficient resolution per image. This dataset provides 20 synthetic models, each with an associated multi-lens walkthrough, and the uncompressed video from its generation. This dataset can be used for multi-view compression, multi-view streaming, view-interpolation, or other computer graphics related research.
