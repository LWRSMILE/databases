5 original grayscale images were used, 100 distorted images were generated from 10 watermarking algorithms with 2 embedding strengths. These algorithms have the advantage to generate very different type of distortions. Subjective evaluations were made at viewing distance of 6 times the screen height using a DSIS (Double Stimulus Impairment Scale) method with 5 categories and 16 observers. Distortions for each processing and each image have been optimised in order to uniformly cover the subjective scale.
