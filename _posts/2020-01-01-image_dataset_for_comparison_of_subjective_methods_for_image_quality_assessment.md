The major methods for data analysis are reviewed, such as establishing confidence intervals, statistical testing and retrospective power analysis. Two methods of visualizing ranking results together with the meaningful information about the statistical and practical significance are explored. Four most prominent subjective quality assessment methods are compared: single-stimulus, double-stimulus, forced-choice pairwise comparison, and similarity judgements. Selected 10 images from the Kodak Photo CD photo sampler collection are used in the experiment.
