There is an urgent need to develop algorithms which are capable of grouping media by the social events they depict or are related to. In order to train, test, and evaluate such algorithms and frameworks, we present a dataset that consists of about 430,000 photos from Flickr together with the underlying ground truth consisting of about 21,000 social events. All the photos are accompanied by their textual metadata. The ground truth for the event groupings has been derived from event calendars on the Web that have been created collaboratively by people. The dataset has been used in the Social Event Detection (SED) task that was part of the MediaEval Benchmark for Multimedia Evaluation 2013. This task required participants to discover social events and organize the related media items in event-specific clusters within a collection of Web multimedia documents.
