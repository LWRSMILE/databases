The package contains: 26 models between 9K and 40K vertices were generated from 4 reference objects. The only distortion is noise addition applied with three strengths, either on smooth or rough regions. Subjective evaluations were made at normal viewing distance, using a Multiple Stimulus Impairment Scale method with 11 observers. A Microsoft excel document giving all subjective quality scores is included in the above archive. It contains also Mean Opinion Scores after normalization and outlier removal. An other Microsoft excel document provides the objective scores of several recent perceptual metrics from the state of the art.
