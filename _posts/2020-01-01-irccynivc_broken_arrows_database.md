10 original grayscale images were used (5 natural images: BOWS2 DB and 5 art images: EROS DB), 120 distorted images were generated with 6 different embedding strength, and either with or without CSF weighting function. These "Broken Arrows" watermarking algorithm was used (see the "bows2" contest). Subjective evaluations were made at viewing distance of 6 times the screen height using a DSIS (Double Stimulus Impairment Scale) method with 5 categories and 17 observers. Distortions for each processing and each image have been optimized in order to uniformly cover the subjective scale.
