The database contains a series of 3D HDTV subjective tests that we performed with help of over 120 observers. The aim was to compare several aspects of video image quality and QoE reported on different stereoscopic display systems for home entertainment, including active shutter glass display, polarized glass display and active shutter glass projection system. We used original video sequences created from different types of sources (blu-ray disc records, 3D camcorder, satellite reception and static images). The subjective tests were realized in the Laboratory of digital television at Department of Radio Electronics, Brno University of Technology. The user ratings were gathered through simple questionnaires addressing different aspects of viewing experience. The results of these ratings were evaluated and as a reference the test material will very soon be available in the DEIMOS database.
