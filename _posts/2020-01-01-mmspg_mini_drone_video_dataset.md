The created dataset consists of 38 different contents captured in full HD resolution, with a duration of 16 to 24 seconds each, shot with the mini-drone Phantom 2 Vision+ in a parking lot. The dataset contents can be clustered in three categories: normal, suspicious, and illicit behaviors. Normal content depicts people walking, getting in their cars and parking their vehicles. In suspicious content, nothing a priori wrong happens but people act in a questionable way. Contents with illicit behaviors show people mis-parking their vehicles, stealing items and cars, or fighting. All participants read and signed a consent form, stating they agree to appear with their vehicles in the video. Drone-based surveillance is particularly advantageous when it is not possible to set up a full-fledged surveillance system, for example, when a temporary major event such as a concert or a marathon is organized. Mini-drones can be used for monitoring the area, helping in managing parking spaces, controlling crowds and reporting useful information such as suspicious behaviors, mis-parked cars, number of free parking spots, etc.
