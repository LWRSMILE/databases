An open platform for collecting, annotating, and sharing surveillance videos. Most of the included videos are annotated, based on a reference ontology which integrates hundreds of concepts, some of them coming from the LSCOM and MediaMill ontologies. The ViSOR (Video Surveillance Online Repository) is a framework, designed with the aim of establishing an open platform for collecting, annotating, retrieving, and sharing surveillance videos, as well as evaluating the performance of automatic surveillance systems. Annotations are based on a reference ontology which has been defined integrating hundreds of concepts, some of them coming from the LSCOM and MediaMill ontologies. A new annotation classification schema is also provided, which is aimed at identifying the spatial, temporal and domain detail level used. The ViSOR web interface allows video browsing, querying by annotated concepts or by keywords, compressed video previewing, media downloading and uploading. Finally, ViSOR includes a performance evaluation desk which can be used to compare different annotations.
