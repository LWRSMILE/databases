Proliferation of mobile devices with video recording capability has lead to a tremendous growth in the amount of user-generated mobile videos. Researchers have embarked on developing new interesting applications and enhancement algorithms for mobile video. There is, however, no standard dataset with videos that could represent characteristics of mobile videos captured in realistic scenarios. The presented dataset consists of videos simultaneously recorded using mobile devices in an unconstrained manner by multiple users attending performance events. Each video is accompanied by concurrent readings from accelerometer and compass sensors. At the time of writing, the dataset contains 473 video clips, with a total length of 30 hours 41 minutes and total size of 122.8 GB. This dataset is useful as a common benchmark dataset for a variety of different research topics on mobile videos, including video analytics, video quality enhancement, and automatic video mashups.
